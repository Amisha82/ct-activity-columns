In this exercise,Â you're going to convert a layout which was designed for mobile to also work on tablet and desktop browsers.

1.  For screens bigger than 480 pixels:
    *   allow items within an article to wrap
    *   force the sidebar to take up 100% of its parent's height
2.  For screens larger than 640 pixels:
    *   sections should also take up 100% of their parent's height

When done correctly, the tablet view (greater than 480 pixels) should have a full-height sidebar and one column of sections. Conversely, the desktop view (greater than 640 pixels) should have a sidebar and sections that fit on a single row.
